POC, description, Project incl years

A hardware section is required and should include the following information;

-   Information on your recorders
-   Array configurations and diagrams
-   Platform information (towed, moored, drifting, etc.)
-   Other sensors included (GPS devices, depth senors, etc.)

This will be variable for each center and may change from project to project. You should list all hardware, present and past.

You can also link to a separate hardware repository if needed ([SAEL example](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/SAEL-lab-manual/content/Hardware_ADRIFT.html))

This can be a section with subpages or a qmd
